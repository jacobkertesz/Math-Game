# Overview

This program runs a math game which displays random math problems for the user to solve within a limited time frame. 
The game is found at https://jacobkertesz.github.io/mathgame/ 

The purpose of creating this program was to give me an opportunity to learn the basic syntax of Javascript.

# Development Environment

I used functions, variables, and arrays to generate and record game information; event listeners for user input; and DOM manipulation to display outputs.

I used javascript and HTML languages as well as the Math.js library.

# Future Work

- Add a three second delay between when "Start" is clicked and the game starts.
- Add a selection screen before the game allowing the user to select what math types will be present and how high the numbers are
- Modify similar lines in generateAddition and generateSubtraction so the similar lines only appear once
- Have the timer count in real seconds 
- Add a scoring system
